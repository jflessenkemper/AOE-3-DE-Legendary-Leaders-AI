"""Fully-automated 100%-civ-coverage skirmish matrix runner.

Stitches together:
  - lobby_driver.py       — pixel-coord-driven Skirmish-lobby control
  - in_game_driver.py     — GameDriver: launch/wait/speed/resign lifecycle
  - log_capture.py        — Age3Log.txt mirror per match
  - manage_game.py        — process lifecycle / crash recovery

For every civ_idx in `picker_scroll_table.json["civ_names"]` (skipping
idx 0 = Random Personality by default) we:

  1. Verify game is alive at clean Skirmish lobby; relaunch + recover if not.
  2. Open civ picker, scroll to target row (using the empirical scroll table
     since one wheel-down ≠ one row), click civ, OK.
  3. Start Age3Log.txt mirror to artifacts/matrix/<idx>/match.log.
  4. Click PLAY.
  5. Wait for `WorldAssetPreloadingTime` (match playable).
  6. Set max speed (tick 5 = ~Fast x effective).
  7. Observe `observe_seconds` of gameplay (default 600 = ~10 min wall).
  8. Resign → confirm → return to main menu.
  9. Stop log mirror; write per-civ summary.
  10. Re-enter Skirmish lobby; reset P1 to Random Personality.

Crash recovery: if any step throws or the game exits, we call
`manage_game.cycle` (close + relaunch + main menu) and continue with the
NEXT civ. No iteration ever blocks the matrix indefinitely.

Run from gamescope-host context (game already at lobby helps but isn't
required):
    flatpak-spawn --host python3 tools/aoe3_automation/matrix_runner.py \\
        --observe-seconds 600 --start-idx 1 --end-idx 48

Use --dry-run to skip the actual PLAY (just exercises the lobby flow per civ).
Use --civs aztec_empire,spain  to run a subset by name.
