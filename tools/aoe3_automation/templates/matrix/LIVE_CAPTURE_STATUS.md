# Live Template Capture — Status (2026-04-28)

_Captured against `Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition v100.15.59076.0 P2`, mod `Legendary Leaders AI` enabled, gamescope `1920×1080@60`, English locale._

## What worked

- AoE3 launched cleanly under gamescope (PID-tree includes `gamescope -W 1920 -H 1080 -r 60 → reaper → Proton → AoE3DE_s.exe`). The embedded Xwayland is on `:1`, gamescope wayland socket at `/run/user/1000/gamescope-0`.
- **Screen capture works** via `gamescopectl screenshot <abs-path>` — produces a real 1920×1080 PNG of the actual game framebuffer (≈4.5 MB sRGB).
  - `grim` does NOT work (gamescope doesn't expose the wlr-screencopy protocol).
  - `import -display :1 -window root` returns an all-black 1×1-pixel canvas (gamescope's Xwayland is rootless and doesn't backref the rendered framebuffer).
- **Mouse + keyboard input works** via `xdotool` against `DISPLAY=:1`. Verified: keyboard (`Down × N + Return` navigates main menu) and mouse (`mousemove → click 1` reached and opened the team-color dropdown).
- **OCR is unreliable** on this UI font (Trajan-style caps on textured wood). Tesseract reads almost nothing on the main menu and lobby even with thresholding/inversion — only single tokens like `HOME` matched. **Plan: rely on coord-based clicks + image templates rather than `click_text` for menu navigation.** OCR may still work for the larger result-screen text (`Victory`/`Defeat`).

## Captured raw screenshots

`_raw/01_main_menu.png` — 1920×1080, full main menu
`_raw/05_skirmish_lobby.png` — 1920×1080, Single Player Skirmish lobby (default 8-player Free For All, Great Lakes, Supremacy, Hard, Fast)

## Cropped templates (verified)

| Template | Source | Crop | Verified |
|----------|--------|------|----------|
| `skirmish_button.png` | 01_main_menu | 200×55 + 30,460 | ✅ shows "SKIRMISH" |
| `continue_button.png` | 01_main_menu | 200×55 + 30,200 | ✅ shows "CONTINUE" |
| `start_game_button.png` | 05_skirmish_lobby | 400×70 + 1480,1000 | ✅ shows "PLAY" |

## Confirmed click coordinates (1920×1080 lobby and main menu)

| Element | (x, y) center | How verified |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Main menu → Skirmish item | `(130, 488)` | mouse click → lobby opened |
| Main menu → Down-arrow keynav | `Down × 4 + Return` | landed on Historical Battles (item 4 from Continue=1) |
| Lobby → Player 1 team color dropdown ("1") | `(1060, 140)` | mouse click → opened color picker |
| Lobby → PLAY button | approx `(1700, 1030)` | not yet clicked, but visually clear |
| Lobby → Back (top-left) | `Escape` key works (returns to main menu) |

## Coordinates that need empirical confirmation

These were inferred but not verified to trigger their UI:

- Lobby → Player 1 civ "?" dropdown — likely between `x=860` and `x=1000` at `y≈140-200`, but pixel-sweep showed only wood-colored RGB everywhere in that range. The `?` placeholder appears to be drawn in the same dark-wood tone as the background; the clickable area location is not yet pinned.
- Game Speed dropdown (right column, near bottom)
- Game Rules dropdown
- Difficulty dropdown
- Map select (Great Lakes)
- Advanced Settings — **probably not a separate panel in AoE3 DE**. Settings like Reveal Map / Game Speed / Handicap are individual dropdowns/toggles in the right column of the lobby (no nested "Advanced" panel).

## Templates still missing

From the original 10-template list in `HARNESS_EXTENSIONS.md`:

1. ~~`single_player_button.png`~~ — **not needed**: AoE3 DE main menu shows Skirmish directly.
2. `skirmish_button.png` ✅
3. `dismiss_update.png` — optional; not seen in this session.
4. `player1_civ_dropdown.png` — **needed but coords unconfirmed**.
5. `leader_dropdown.png` — **needs investigation**: AoE3 DE may put leader inside the civ-picker rather than a separate dropdown. Open civ "?" first to see.
6. ~~`advanced_settings_button.png`~~ — likely not applicable; settings are inline.
7. `game_speed_fastest.png` — needs Game Speed dropdown opened to capture.
8. `reveal_map_on.png` — needs the Game Rules / settings dropdown opened.
9. ~~`advanced_settings_close.png`~~ — likely not applicable.
10. `start_game_button.png` ✅

## Recommended next steps (10-minute manual session at the rig)

With the game already at the lobby, do one Skirmish-prep walk and run `gamescopectl screenshot <path>` at each state. The expensive part (figuring out gamescope, X displays, screenshot mechanism) is solved; this is now point-and-shoot.

1. Click the P1 civ "?" — write down the cursor's last position (xdotool getmouselocation reports it). Capture the open civ-picker.
2. Pick any civ (e.g. British). Capture the lobby with civ filled in.
3. If a leader-portrait dropdown appears next to the civ box: capture it.
4. Open Game Speed dropdown → capture → crop the "Fastest" entry into `game_speed_fastest.png`.
5. Open the "Game Rules" dropdown (currently "Standard") → look for `Reveal Map` toggle → capture → crop.
6. Save raw PNGs to `_raw/` named `11_civ_picker_open.png`, `12_with_civ.png`, `13_speed_open.png`, `14_rules_open.png`.

Then re-run `python3 tools/aoe3_automation/flows/matrix_run_all.py --dry-run` and the existing flow JSON should template-match against the captured chrome.

## Alternative flow without full template set

If template capture remains awkward, the matrix flow can be rewritten to use direct coord clicks:

```json
{ "action": "click", "x": 130, "y": 488 }      // → enter Skirmish lobby
{ "action": "click", "x": 920, "y": 145 }      // → open P1 civ dropdown (needs confirmed coord)
{ "action": "click_text", "texts": ["${CIV_NAME}"] }  // pick civ from open list (OCR may struggle on civ names; backup: arrow-key nav)
{ "action": "click", "x": 1700, "y": 1030 }    // → PLAY
{ "action": "wait_text", "texts": ["Victory","Defeat"], "timeout": 3600 }
```

`click_text` will work for **larger result-screen text** (Victory/Defeat) but is unreliable on the lobby's small Trajan caps. If we can pin the civ-list y-coords once (each list entry sits at a fixed pixel offset relative to the dropdown header), we can drop OCR entirely and pick by `(x, y_header + civ_index × row_height)`.
