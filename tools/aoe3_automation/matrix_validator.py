"""Consolidate matrix_report.json into a per-civ × per-axis coverage grid.

The matrix runner exercises every civ in batches of 1..8 and records a rich
set of evidence per match:

  * **selected_civ**         — picker clicked through OK
  * **reached_in_game**      — HUD detected (preload + match start)
  * **ai_scripts_loaded**    — count of XS scripts in the replay payload
  * **personality_probe_count** — sentinel-tagged uservar blocks on disk
  * **loading_screen_captured** — leader-card PNG present
  * **in_game_captured**     — HUD PNG present
  * **scoreboard_captured**  — Tab-overlay PNG present
  * **static_validators**    — tools/test.sh exit 0 (counted once, applies
                               to every civ)

Each batch head dir on disk owns the visual + audio evidence; opponents in
the same batch share that evidence (all civs are in the same loading and
scoreboard frames).  AI-load and personality-probe counts are batch-level
totals that we credit to every civ in the batch (the replay carries each
opponent's compiled XS independently).

Usage
-----

    python3 -m tools.aoe3_automation.matrix_validator
    python3 -m tools.aoe3_automation.matrix_validator --json
    python3 -m tools.aoe3_automation.matrix_validator --update-readme

Exit codes:
  0 — every axis at 100%
  1 — at least one axis < 100% (still emits the report so the user can see
      exactly which civs/axes failed)
  2 — matrix_report.json missing or unparseable
