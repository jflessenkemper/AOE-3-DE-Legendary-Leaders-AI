"""Age3Log.txt per-match slice capture helper.

AoE3 DE appends all output — including aiEcho() lines from the XS AI scripts —
to a single Age3Log.txt file.  To attribute probes to a specific match we:

  1. Snapshot the file's byte offset BEFORE starting the match.
  2. After resigning, read from that offset to end-of-file.
  3. Save the delta as ``match.log`` next to the other match artefacts.

The validator (tools/playtest/replay_probes.py) then parses match.log directly
for ``[LLP v=2 ...]`` lines — no decompression or replay parsing needed.

Dev-mode requirement
--------------------
aiEcho() only writes to Age3Log.txt when the game runs with developer mode
enabled.  On this rig that is achieved by placing a ``user.cfg`` file containing
the bare token ``developer`` in:

    ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/933110/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/
    Games/Age of Empires 3 DE/76561198170207043/Startup/user.cfg

manage_game.py open() ensures this file exists before launching the game.
Without it, aiEcho() calls are silently dropped and match.log will contain
zero probe lines.

Usage::

    from tools.aoe3_automation.log_capture import snapshot_offset, read_since, AGE3_LOG_PATH

    offset = snapshot_offset()          # call BEFORE starting match
    # ... run match ...
    content = read_since(offset)        # call AFTER resigning
    Path("pack_1/match.log").write_text(content, encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")

#
# AoE3 DE buffers Age3Log.txt writes (especially XS aiEcho output) in process
# memory and only flushes on certain events (mode transitions, clean exit).
# A D3D11 crash mid-match dumps the unflushed buffer — we lose all probes
# emitted since the last flush.
#
# We can't force the engine to flush, but we CAN persistently mirror whatever
# IS on disk to a per-match file in real time.  That gives us:
#   1. Crash-resilience: bytes that reached the disk never get lost.
#   2. A single per-match file we can poll for early-exit-on-coverage.
#   3. No data race with the game (we only ever read).
#
# The mirror runs as a daemon thread that polls Age3Log.txt size every
# `poll_interval` seconds and appends new bytes to the destination file.
