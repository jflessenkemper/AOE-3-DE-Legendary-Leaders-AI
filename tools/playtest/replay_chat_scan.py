"""AI-script-load diagnostic via decompressed replay payload.

Background
----------
NIGHT_JOURNAL lists three theories for "0 personality probes after every
match":

  1. AI not loading at all (no positive proof either way without aiEcho).
  2. ``aiPersonalitySetPlayerUserVar`` is in-memory only (write happens but
     doesn't persist to disk).
  3. Wrong personality file is being targeted.

Theory #1 has been impossible to test because every observable channel
(aiEcho, aiChat, personality writes) sits *downstream* of the AI loading.
If the AI never loads, every channel reads zero — but for different
reasons than if it loads-then-fails-to-write.

This tool gives us ground truth on theory #1.

How it works
------------
A .age3Yrec replay is ``l33t\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00`` + a single zlib stream
(verified 2026-04-29 on a 21 MB live replay; previously undocumented).
After ``zlib.decompress`` the payload contains, among other things, the
**compiled XS script blob for each AI player** stitched into the replay
header so the engine can replay deterministically. Each AI's blob carries
its own copy of any string literals from the script — including the
``[LLP v=2 t=`` format-string template defined in
``aiUtilities.xs::llProbe`` and the tag literals (``meta.boot``,
``meta.gameover``, etc.).

So the count of ``[LLP v=2 t=`` literal hits in a decompressed replay
equals the number of AI players whose XS script was loaded. In a 1v7
match: 7 hits = all AI loaded; 0 hits = AI failed to load entirely.

This does NOT recover the runtime probe values — those go through chat,
which IS string-table indexed (the original ``replay_probes.py``
docstring was right about that). To recover values we still need the
personality-uservar channel (``probes_from_replay.py``) or a new
disk-write channel.

Usage
-----
    python3 -m tools.playtest.replay_chat_scan PATH.age3Yrec
    python3 -m tools.playtest.replay_chat_scan PATH.age3Yrec --json
    python3 -m tools.playtest.replay_chat_scan PATH.age3Yrec --expected 7

Exit codes:
  0 — at least one AI script loaded
  1 — fewer scripts than --expected (set with --expected N)
  2 — file missing or unreadable
