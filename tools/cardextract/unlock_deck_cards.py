"""Lower the <level> unlock requirement to 0 for every card referenced by
the Legendary Leaders deck in each mod civ homecity XML.

Why: AoE3 DE gates cards behind home city level (0/10/25/40). A fresh player
starts at HC level 1, so any deck card with level > 1 is dropped from the
Deck Builder display — that's why Chileans showed 13/25 instead of 25/25.

For the curated Legendary Leaders deck we want every card playable from the
very first match. This script walks each rvltmodhomecity*.xml, finds the
Legendary Leaders deck, and for every card in that deck also sets its
corresponding <cards>/<card>/<level> entry in the pool to 0.

Idempotent.
