"""Expand each mod civ homecity XML so the Legendary Leaders deck appears
under all six standard deck-name slots (Beginner / Land / Naval / Tycoon /
Treaty / Treaty-Natives). Each slot contains the same curated 25 cards.

Why: when the template had only our custom "Legendary Leaders" deck, the
game auto-generated its own 6 standard decks from the card pool at savegame
creation, erasing our curated content. By pre-populating all 6 standard
named decks with our 25 curated cards, the game preserves them and players
see the Legendary Leaders curation in every slot.

Idempotent.
