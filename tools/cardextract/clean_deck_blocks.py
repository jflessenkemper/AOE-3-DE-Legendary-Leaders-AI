"""Strip legacy double-deck content from each Card Deck <details> block in
LEGENDARY_LEADERS_TREE.html so every nation shows ONLY the curated icon
deck the AI actually plays.

Three legacy patterns being removed:

  1. Revolution civs had a stale `<p>Mod home city: <code>X.xml</code>.
     Full deck set: Beginner, Land, Naval, Tycoon, Treaty.</p>` intro that
     no longer matches reality (we now override with one Legendary
     Leaders deck).

  2. Standard civs had `<p>Base game home city. The AI selects an
     Enhanced-Land or Enhanced-Naval pre-built deck if one exists, or
     builds a deck dynamically card-by-card.</p>` — also stale, since
     our XML overrides force the curated Legendary Leaders deck.

  3. A handful of standard civs (Aztecs, etc.) had a hand-curated
     TEXT-ONLY deck (`<dl class="buildparam">` + a "Bespoke deck
     designed for…" intro paragraph + a custom summary label like
     "Card Deck: Flower War & Tribute (25 cards, curated)") sitting
     ABOVE our injected icon deck — a duplicate.

After this script every Card Deck section has exactly:

    <details><summary><span class="cat-label">Card Deck</span></summary>
      <!-- (STD-)?DECK-START civ -->
        ... icon deck ...
      <!-- (STD-)?DECK-END civ -->
    </details>

Idempotent.
